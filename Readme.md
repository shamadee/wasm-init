# **wasm-init**

## Work environment and code generator for WebAssembly projects

wasm-init abstracts the WebAssembly setup and compile process and aims to dramatically simplify the development workflow.
<br><br>
## **Install**

This package requires that you have [**Emscripten**](https://github.com/juj/emsdk.git) installed on your machine. You can get it like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/juj/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk install sdk-incoming-64bit binaryen-master-64bit
./emsdk activate sdk-incoming-64bit binaryen-master-64bit
```
(Note, that the install will take a while. More information is [here](http://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/).)


The best way to install this module is via `npm install wasm-init`.
<br><br>

## **Use**

### **Quick Setup**

* Add the following scripts to your project's package JSON: 
```json
  "scripts": {
    "wasm-init": "wasm-init",
    "compile": "wasm-compile",
    "start": "gulp" // optional for hot-reloading
  }
```

* `npm run wasm-init minimal`

* Add the relative path to the emsdk folder in your *wasm.config.js* file

* `npm run wasm-init build`

* `node server` and go to *localhost:3000*, open the console and check that WASM has loaded successfully

* make changes to your C++ file and recompile with `npm run compile`
<br>
<br>

## **The whole story**

At the heart of wasm-init is the *wasm.config.js* file, which takes Emscripten's compile process and breaks it down into configurable elements. To compile C++ to WASM with Emscripten, you need at bare minimum the following properties:
```javascript
// wasm.config.js
module.exports = {
  emscripten_path: './../emsdk',
  inputfile: 'lib.cpp',
  outputfile: 'lib.js',
  flags: [
    '-s WASM=1',
  ],
};
```
`emscripten_path` is the relative path to the *emsdk* directory, from your project folder. (In the above case, we would expect Emscripten to be located in the same parent-directory as the project.)
<br>
<br>

### **Templates**
These scripts make the module's functionality accessible. Be aware that `npm run wasm-init` **will create several files and folders inside your project directory.** This is your fastest route to a working project setup; however, you can set up all the files manually, if you so desire.
<br>
<br>
### **Custom**
The best way to the custom setup is to start with the wasm.config.js file (you can generate it with npm run wasm-init minimal), and enter the emcc_path, inputfiles, outputfile, and flags according to your needs. When you run npm run wasm-init build, the program will generate these files for you.

To compile, simply use npm run compile to compile the C++ code, and the program will output a JavaScript file with Emscripten bindings, as well as the sought after.wasm file. To take advantage of wasm-init's easy loading mechanism for WebAssembly modules, you will need the wrapper file loadWASM.js. The wasm module is from there returned by a promise. Making the module accessible to your application is as easy as the following:
```javascript
let m = {}
loadWASM().then(wasmModule => {
  m = wasmModule;
  m._myFunc(); // this is the call to the C++ function myFunc();
});
```

When you want to export individual functions from C++ to WASM, you can do this with the *exported_functions* property in wasm.config.js:
```javascript
...
  exported_functions: [
    '_myFunc',
  ]
...
```
It is required to **prepend the C++ function names with an underscore!**, 
<br><br><br>
If you are on board with wasm-init's automation, the quickest road to success would be:
`npm run wasm-init emcc_path=./../emsdk` (modify path accordingly). This will set Emscripten's file path in the wasm.config.js file automatically. This will also install and compile all necessary files, including a server.js, index.js and index.html file, that are already setup to include WASM in the browser. <br>
(**Executing `npm run wasm-init` will overwrite any files that may already be there, as does `npm run wasm-init build`!** ).

If you now run your browser (either manually or with gulp), and go to localhost:3000, open up the console, and you should see the message from the C++ file printed.
<br><br>
### **Flags**
The following flags for `npm run wasm-init` are usable:
<br><br> 

`build`       - builds files according to instructions in wasm.config.js

`minimal`     - only creates the wasm.config.js file

`no-wrapper`  - no wrapper (loadWASM.js) file

`no-cpp`      - no C++ file

`no-indexjs`  - no index.js file

`no-html`     - no html file

`no-server`   - no server.js file

<br>
If you want built-in hot-reloading functionality, via gulp and browser-sync, just add the flag 

`hot` .

Note, that this will install the gulp and browser-sync packages automatically. This will also generate a gulpfile.js file, which is already setup to work with the template code.

<br>
Lastly,

`npm run wasm-init clean`

will **delete the autogenerated files**, except wasm.config.js .

`npm run wasm-init clean-all`

will **delete all autogenerated files**. Please use it carefully!
